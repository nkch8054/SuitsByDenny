The suit fabrics L&K is offering are excellent. My oldest suit is now five years old and still in perfect condition - not even the back up trousers touched.

They have pushy salesman out on the streets in Hong Kong. Which I really don't like. However I gave them a try anyway. And I'm very glad that I did. They come across as almost a little bit crazy but they are actually incredibly detail-oriented and the result is a really well-made suit that fits perfectly. Not to mention for a fraction of what a cheap suit would cost in the United States. I fully intend to stop through Hong Kong again and get at least a couple more suits from these guys.","time":1522542686,"user":{"name":"Vog Diesel","avatar":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VTvBF0-k78c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdaWiek35gTFT-4MWx2N8TLh4WIwQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","www":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102348991463245607329/reviews"}}]});
